How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

  - It was really easy. My pair was amazing and gave awesome ideas in regards to how we want the end result to be. Working with a pair for me was easier. The HTML part was a breeze.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

  - It definitely is helpful because as we were coding the html, I always had the wireframe to guide me as to what the end layout is so I knew exactly how to structure the html for later.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

  - We decided that a good wireframe should be clear and concise. Straight to the point with good labeling so that the html would be easily clear to code.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

  - All of the semantic elements I feel we already knew prior.

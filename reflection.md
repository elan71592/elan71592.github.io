What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

  - I learned a lot about how each one works. I kind of already knew and understood each one individually before starting any of the css challenges but this showed me a lot more of each one and how it works because I was constantly mixing up padding with margin and sometimes just literally playing guessing games with myself on it. Padding will always work with the inside while margins work with the outside.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

  - It isn't so easy to position things the way need be. I'm still not good at positioning AT ALL and I'm trying to get better at it. Hopefully I'll be able to really understand it better with more practice.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

  - I didn't like my design at all. As I started building it, my ideas completely switched and I ended up going with a completely new idea. However, I found that my design was pretty hard to implement. Not so much in getting it to look the way I want it but just knowing in the back of my head that whatever css I did is wrong bothers me.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

  - I learned that it's great to have a lot of elements because you can split up your content into different sections so it would be easier to style.
